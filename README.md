# SFSWM

SFSWM (Spark Filtered Spaced Words Matches) is a distributed implementation of the
FSWM algorithm. The procedure estimates the distance between pairs of genomic
sequences through an alignment-free approach. Instead of extracting kmers from the
sequences, the algorithm works on the so called spaced words.
